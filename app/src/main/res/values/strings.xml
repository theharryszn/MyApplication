Or, to be more precise, their consistency in dropping points against struggling opponents is the reason they are now six points adrift of fourth spot. Saturday\'s 1-0 defeat at Bournemouth -- just six days after their 7-0 rout of Manchester United -- was the second time this season that Liverpool have lost to a team that started the day at the bottom of the table. You could even argue that it was the third instance, with United starting Matchday 3 as the bottom team, before moving up a spot on goal difference because of other results before kick-off, when beating Liverpool 2-1 at Old Trafford in August.</string>
